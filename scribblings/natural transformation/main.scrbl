@title[#:tag "_Natural_Transformation_"]{Natural Transformation}

In this @seclink["_Natural_Transformation_"]{chapter}, we extend our exploration
of @tech{category theory} by introducing the concept of @tech{natural transformation}.
@tech{Natural transformations} provide a structured way to understand how
@tech{functors} between two @tech{categories} relate to each other.

Building on our foundation of @tech{categories} and @tech{functors}, this
@seclink["_Natural_Transformation_"]{chapter} presents @tech{natural transformations}
in a unique way: they are defined as @tech{functions} that map @tech{morphisms}
in the @tech{domain} @tech{category} to corresponding @tech{morphisms} in the
@tech{codomain} @tech{category}, similar to @tech{functors}, while ensuring
certain @tech{commutative} properties hold. This approach highlights that
@tech{functors} themselves can be viewed as special @tech{natural transformations},
much like @tech{objects} can be viewed as special @tech{morphisms}, specifically
as @tech{identity morphisms}.

As in the previous @seclink["_Functor_"]{chapter}, we'll leverage Typed Racket
to illustrate the core principles, allowing us to express these abstract
mathematical concepts through practical programming constructs.

@section{Natural Transformation}

A @deftech{natural transformation} @math{α} between @tech{parallel}
@tech{functors} @math{F, G: 𝒞 → 𝒟}, denoted as @math{α: F @deftech{⇒} G}, is a
way to map each @tech{morphism} @math{f: a → b} in @math{𝒞} to a corresponding
@tech{morphism} @math{α(f): F(a) → G(b)} in @math{𝒟}. This mapping must ensure
that the following @tech{diagram} is @tech{commutative}:

To verify the properties of @tech{natural transformations}, we'll @racket[define]
some @tech{check} @tech{procedures} to automate the testing of the
@deftech{naturality} a @tech{natural transformation} has:
